jQuery-UI-Layout
================

This is a handmade fork of the [jQuery Layout Plugin](http://layout.jquery-dev.net/) as developed by Kevin Dalman.

The official website only includes single file downloads, whilst the author himself [states](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/jquery-ui-layout/repository/jquery-ui-layout/kOVxn-KYnxk/nGRZ0LKcRpIJ)

> There is not (sic) repository since I am not collaborating on the plugin

Therefore this little handy repo - open for collaboration of course.
